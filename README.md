# Wordle-Game-Project
Description
This project is a terminal-based implementation of the popular game Wordle, written entirely in C. It features two distinct game modes:

Human Mode: You play the game manually, trying to guess the hidden 5-letter word within 6 attempts.

Automatic Solver: An AI bot plays the game itself. It uses a "filtering" algorithm to eliminate impossible words based on feedback and finds the target word automatically.

The objective of this project is to demonstrate efficient string manipulation, file handling, and algorithmic logic (filtering search space) in C.
